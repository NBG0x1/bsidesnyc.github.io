  title: "firewalls-- threat or menace?"
  description: "Internet communications is cyclic; provisioning and security decisions are not made with one-off traffic units in mind. Traditional in-path firewalls are for this reason often stateful, but the value-add from such state-keeping comes with a healthy downside: the state-keeping is a new attack surface. Given the fate-sharing that goes on behind a firewall, if an attack against some internal resource has the capability of bringing the firewall down and thus affecting other internal resources, then the firewall implicitly becomes an effective force-multiplier for the attacker. There are other ways to do security, which take better account of an attacker's capabilities and alternatives. For example, protocol-aware rate limiting may offer cheaper deployment cost with a better worst-case outcome."

  title: "Open Up and Say 0x41414141: Attacking Medical Devices"
  description: "Network accessible medical devices are ubiquitous in today’s clinical environment. These devices can be of great aid to healthcare professionals in assessing, treating and monitoring a patient’s condition. However, they can also fall victim to a number of systemic vulnerabilities that can expose personal health information or PHI, compromise the integrity of patient data in transit, and affect the availability of the devices themselves.


  This talk looks at the methodology and approach to penetration testing of modern medical devices. It will provide an overview of the various stages of a medical device assessment, including discovery and analysis of a device’s remote and local attack surface, reverse engineering and exploitation of proprietary network protocols, vulnerability discovery in network services, compromising supporting systems, attacking common wireless protocols, exploitation of hardware debug interfaces and bus protocols and assessing proprietary wireless technologies.


  It will also cover a number of real world vulnerabilities that the speaker has discovered during medical device penetration testing assessments. These include weak cryptographic implementations, device impersonation and data manipulation vulnerabilities in proprietary protocols, unauthenticated database interfaces, hardcoded credentials/keys and other sensitive information stored in firmware/binaries and the susceptibility of medical devices to remote denial of service attacks.


  The talk will conclude with some suggestions on how some of the most common classes of medical device vulnerabilities might be remediated by vendors and also how hospitals and other healthcare providers can defend their medical devices in the meantime."

  title: "The Politics of Intelligence: Applying History to Modern Day Cyber Threat Intelligence"
  description: "How many organizations have an effective strategic threat intelligence operation? Many have failed and many struggle to obtain executive buy in or even mild interest in any of their cyber threat intelligence reports. By examining the history of the POTUS's use of intelligence, some powerful lessons can be learned. For instance, one president created and relied on his own private intelligence group of peers. Another president ignored SIGINT completely because of a preference for \"cloaks and daggers\". Yet another president, told the intelligence community their analysis will support a decision he has already made! These are all important insights into executive leadership, their psychology, and how best to serve their intelligence needs. This presentation will highlight and summarize several key lessons which can be applied to create or improve upon a strategic threat intelligence program."

  title: "Evading C2 Detection with Asymmetry"
  description: "Detecting callouts to command-and-control (C2) servers used to be straightforward, but attackers in your network have found ways to communicate with the outside world even under the heaviest of scrutiny. In this talk, we discuss ways to use popular websites as means of getting commands and exfiltrating information. We examine the applications of asymmetric communication, from Internet-accessible computers to embedded devices to air-gapped systems. Finally, we give some suggestions to defenders, and discuss how to detect and mitigate risks that enable asymmetric malware."

  title: "Threat-Based Risk Management"
  description: "The security industry has been talking about powerful concepts like good threat intelligence and attacker cost for a long time now, but most organizations are not using these concepts in their security programs, causing them to waste money, time, and energy on efforts that do not stop real attackers.


  In this talk, we describe a security program built around adversary intelligence that actually matters.  We describe how this program generates more accurate and precise priorities and objectives. We demonstrate how these new risk profiles, attacker playbooks, and attacker cost models can help inform better controls, strategies, and policies.


  We focus on picking the controls that are most effective at reducing the risk of successful execution of the playbooks that attackers use everyday.  This is only possible with a security program built around attacker intelligence.


  We take a deep dive into the practicalities of implementation of these concepts at your organization.  What metrics matter to show to management, how this impacts hiring, and how this modifies core workflows in the security team.


  Finally, we will close with some of the concrete challenges we encountered in implementing this program and some suggestions on how to work around them."

  description: "Adversarial Simulation, Red Team, Threat Emulation, Blue Team, Targeted Attack Simulation, Purple Team or Gold Team - So many labels and buzzwords. No matter what you call it or whatever color shirt you wear / team you identify most with - this talk offers something for you; no matter the camp you are in.


  At MWR we've spent many years robbing banks, pulling off casino heists, breaching merchants, bringing down Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), flooding mines, stealing all the things and doxing big corps. But more importantly, we've also helped many of those clients make sure none of the stuff we did, could happen for real.


  This presentation will take you on a journey showing you how our TTP's have evolved over the past few years - why we've evolved them, what works now, what doesn't and why - we'll also give you insights into what's coming next. There will be takeaways for everyone - whether your looking to up your offensive game, or as a defender looking to get a heads up on whats gonna be hitting you soon (as well as what to do about it!).


  Having delivered assessments all around the world over several years; as part of and separate to regulatory frameworks such as CBEST, TIBER, iCAST, we've sparred with some heavy hitters and a lot of lessons have been learned - we'd like to share some of these with you. There might just be some entertaining tales too - like that one time we were fingered as a new and shiny Russian APT..."

  title: "Hunting for Lateral Movement"
  description: "After obtaining an initial foothold on an environment, attackers are forced to embark in lateral movement techniques in order to be successful in identifying and exfiltrating sensitive information. To stay ahead of the bad guys, the Blue team needs to have a clear understanding of these techniques as well as the forensic artifacts these techniques leave behind on the victim hosts. Armed with this knowledge, we can proactively hunt for lateral movement in the environment before exfiltration can occur. This presentation will analyze Lateral Movement from both a Red and Blue team perspective and introduce Oriana, a lateral movement hunting tool that can assist the Blue team in catching the adversary."

  description: "Many organizations participate in Security Awareness training. Whether it is something that is produced internally or supplied by a third-party vendor, the goals are the same: educate the user to prevent becoming the next big breach in the news. We all know the phrase ‘you can’t patch humans’, but what metrics can we use to see if our awareness efforts are effective? Believe it or not, Security Analysts have access to a lot of valuable information that can show us just how effective these programs are… and no, I’m not just talking about the results of your last phishing campaign."

  description: "Cranes, trains, building controls, oil rigs, and …ceiling fans? Recent developments have made secure wireless protocols more common, but the fact is there’s still a swarm of simpler RF controls in the wireless world around us. Luckily, the onset of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) means analyzing these insecure signals is easier than ever! We'll explore the basics of capturing and reversing simple RF control signals with the affordable RTL-SDR. With a little exploration through this menagerie of signals, we can unravel the mysteries of their operation and better understand what risk they pose to the environments we protect."

  title: "Moving Graph Analytics to Higher Dimensions to Discover Network Activity / Anomalies that are implicit in behavior - Connections in High Dimensions"
  description: "Advanced mathematics made simpler: Spectral Hypergraph Analysis for mortals.  Imagine lighting up and \"shining\" your network logs through a special prism that would separate behaviors into a \"spectrum\" that would indicate to you things that are going on on your network.   Some of the those things might be important discoveries with security implications.  Doing this would be like how astronomers determine the materials that are burning in a distant star, using a special telescope to get the spectrum of that star's light.  It turns out that there is a mathematical way to do this on network logs, involving a generalization of the Fourier Transform over high dimensional graphs.  This talk will explain this technology in accessible ways, and show examples of its use in discovering \"bad stuff\" on a very large network."

  description: "YARA has recently included a module that enables researchers the creation of more fine grained rules for malware written for the .NET framework. These files contain valuable metadata embedded which can enable us to pinpoint a specific threat and reduce our number of false positives detections.


  This presentation will focus on the peculiarities of obtaining indicators of compromise from .NET malware samples and writing reliable YARA rules using its latest module. I’ll be showing real world examples and releasing a convenient tool that can query metadata information from large sets of .NET files"

  title: "2FA was part of the solution, now it's part of the problem"
  description: "In recent years more services and people have moved to two-factor authentication. While everybody loves talking about the advantages of 2FA, little attention has been given to its downsides. Attackers have started adapting to ubiquitous 2FA and are finding new ways to take over accounts ranging anywhere from email to online banking and (crypto currency) trading services.


  In this talk we will show how attackers can exploit various 2FA and account recovery implementation issues to hijack accounts. We will also propose defensive measures for both architects and end-users."
